# This file allows you to force search name aliases for any rom filename.
# One filename + alias per line. DO NOT ADD THE SUFFIX such as ".zip"!
#
# Note 1! This file is global and will be used when scraping ANY platform.
#
# Note 2! All bracket info in these titles are ignored. This is a search name alias
#         NOT a title alias. It merely provides a different base name for Skyscraper
#         when it creates the search query. It is meant to help scrape files that have
#         abstract file names where the search based scraping modules have a hard time
#         finding good results.
#         If you wish to keep or add brackets to a title you can still do so by adding
#         them to the actual file instead.
#
# Format (without the quotes):
# "Rom Filename (Europe);Use This Name Instead"
